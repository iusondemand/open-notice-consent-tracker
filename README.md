Keep Track Of Your Consents 

This is a simple and disruptive idea: we need a tool to track our consents online.

How many times we say YES online, and we forget the consents we give ?

This bookmarklet isn't the final solution: is an idea to support the participation ot #legalhack in London 8-9 feb 2014 (and NY amd California) and build around it a solution to manage consents and privacy online.

I've come from Milan to offer the code I'm already using for my purposes, and I want to thank Mark Lizar and the Center for Creative Collaboration (univ. of London) and Reubens to help it growing.

We aim to build an entire world and a list of services around it. We are conscious of this and the time will say if it's only a dream or more.

The websites www.legalstxt.org will help people to save their consents, but it will possible to send the agreements and the consents by email, on remote repositories, and manage answers from companies.
